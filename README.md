Introduction to scientific python for people living in confinement (and maybe also other people)

This repository is a **very close** copy of https://github.com/MaxNoe/scientific_python_notebooks so all praise go to [@MaxNoe](https://github.com/MaxNoe) who himself cites:

"""
The material mostly comes from the

* [PeP et al. Toolbox Workshop](https://github.com/pep-dortmund/toolbox-workshop)
* [A workshop for Astronomers and Particle Physicists at IFAE and ICE](https://github.com/Python4AstronomersAndParticlePhysicists/PythonWorkshop-ICE)
* [The Second Asterics-Obelics School 2018](https://github.com/Asterics2020-Obelics/School2018)
* [The Third Asterics-Obelics School 2019](https://github.com/Asterics2020-Obelics/School2019)
* [Python Workshop GRK Uni Freiburg 2019](https://indico.cern.ch/event/846501)

And was put together and presented by [@kbruegge](https://github.com/kbruegge) and me.

For an introduction to machine learning in python, see  
<https://github.com/kbruegge/machine-learning-lecture>  
and our Tutorial @ DPG Fr√ºhjahrstagung Aachen 2019:  
<https://github.com/tudo-astroparticlephysics/dpg2019-ml-tutorial>

Most of the modifications for the first commit of this repository were done by [@Broko55](https://github.com/Broko55) so some praise to him as well.
